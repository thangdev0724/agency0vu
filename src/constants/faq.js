Additionally, the ad account we provide you will have an invoice that shows the amount you have spent, so you can easily check if the balance matches. In your case, the remaining balance would be $170 ($500 – $330), which will be transferred to the ad account in the next cycle we provide you.

  {
    title: "Which one should I choose, an agency account or a regular account?",
    content: `Although we provide both types of accounts: regular and agency accounts.
    I have a recommendation that if the customer’s monthly budget is below $30,000, they should not run ads on an agency account.
    <br />
    Reasons:
    <br />
    – The fees are expensive, with monthly maintenance fees of around $300-400 and setup fees of $400 per session. <br />
    – In other words, with a budget below $30,000 per month, regular ad accounts are usually cheaper than agency accounts by about $700-$800 in the first month and $400 in the following months.<br />
    – While agency accounts are undoubtedly stronger than regular accounts, we provide free replacements if the Facebook ads account gets disabled. In summary, the quality is nearly the same.<br />
    According to my opinion, agency accounts are only suitable for large-scale projects with short running durations, such as ICO campaigns, and require a budget of $10,000 per day or higher.<br />
